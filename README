Wefeelfiner is a tiny script to scrape the wefeelfine.org gallery.

Usage:
 - Install the script on a PHP server
 - Change the full path to the image directory in config.php (optional)
 - Make sure that id.txt and the image directory ('img' by default) are writable
 - Point your browser to crawl.php; hit refresh to download more images
 - It's recommended to use a cronjob or scheduled task to visit the page automatically every hour or something
